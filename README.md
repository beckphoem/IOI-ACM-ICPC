# How to Compile and Run

To compile the C++ file, use the following command:

```sh
g++ -o problem cpp/problem.cpp
```

To run the compiled program, use the following command:

```sh
./problem
```

Make sure to create an input file named `input.inp` in the same directory as the executable, with the input data. The program uses `freopen` to read from this file.
